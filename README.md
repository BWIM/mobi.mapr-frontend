# mobi.mapr Frontend

This is the frontend of the mobility analysation tool *mobi.mapr* by BWIM.

It is hosted on the site https://mapr.mobi as main system, as well as on https://stage.mapr.mobi as staging systems.
Commits on the Main branch are automatically build and pushed to the :latest tag. Every other tag results in an image with the tag :stage-latest.

## Contribute
I am happy about any pull request or issue, that you run into. Please be aware, that this project is solely maintained by @pfennig42.

## Selfhost
The backend is currently proprietary. A publication of it is planned. There is a semi API-Documentation of it. You can host a docker image yourself and just use the API of the backend.
Please be aware, that every part of the back and frontend can have breaking changes.

## Documentation
This project is currently not very well documented. Neither the API of the backend, nor the code itself. I am glad, if you help improving it. A wiki is planned.
For generel topics, please advise the main site of the mobi.mapr: bw-im.de/mobimapr.

## Funding
This project is fully developed by the Baden-Württemberg Institut für nachhaltige Mobilität (BWIM).
